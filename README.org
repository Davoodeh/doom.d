#+TITLE: MY Emacs DOOM conf

This repo is a module of my [[https://github.com/davoodeh/.files][.files]] repo.

An Emacs config from a noob for noobs.

It's a [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][DOOM]] config focused on Persian/bidi, LaTeX and Org support.

To install just clone my [[https://github.com/davoodeh/.files][.files]] in your home or clone this repo in your =$DOOMDIR=
(in my config: =~/.config/doom.d=) (default: =~/.doom.d=) and install DOOM by cloning and running it.
The summary is:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd
git clone https://github.com/davoodeh/doom.d .doom.d
git clone https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom .emacs.d
.emacs.d/bin/doom install
#+END_SRC

P.S for Iranian fellas: Some Emacs packages are hosted on GitLab which means you should change your DNS/IP before running ~doom~.
Otherwise it might fail.

Yet figuring it out!
